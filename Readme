pokedex.py uses args.py to parses the command line arguments, makes a list of requests from them, sends that list of
requests to pokeapigetter, that calls pokedexrequest (the facade pattern implementation) which talks to the files in
pokeretriever package that gets the json from the api, and parses the json into PokedexObject objects, that gets return-
ed to pokedex, and then uses the methods in report to output the results.

program will use sys exit when it catches an exception to exit.
